CLPS 0950 Intro to programming - pythonFinalProject 

We have created a version of the New York Times Mini Crossword Puzzle using Python in VS Code. The hints are programming-themed, using vocabulary we have learned throughout the semester.

After running the code, an introduction screen will appear with the following instructions:

    1. Guess each word in the crossword.
    2. Use the CHECK button to check if the words are correct once you are done with the puzzle.
    3. If the letter in the box is correct, the letter will turn GREEN, and if the letter is incorrect the letter will turn RED.
    4. Use the CLEAR button to clear the grid.
    5. Click on a box to start typing a word, and click on the same box again to change the direction of the word.
    6. Press BACKSPACE to delete a letter.
    7. Press SPACE to start the game.

Before guessing, ensure that the entire row or column is highlighted in light blue so that you can begin typing.

Good luck!
